# Financial and Election Analysis with Python

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing financial and election data. The scripts calculate various metrics and generate analysis reports based on CSV files containing the data.

## PyBank
This Python script analyzes financial records to calculate key metrics such as total months, net total profit/loss, average change, and identifies the greatest increase and decrease in profits over the period. The analysis is based on a CSV file containing financial data.

### Instructions
1. run main.py script in the pybank folder to get results.

### Financial Analysis Results
Upon running the script, the following financial analysis results will be displayed in the console:
- Total months in the dataset
- Net total amount of profit/losses
- Average change in profit/losses
- Greatest increase in profits (with corresponding month)
- Greatest decrease in profits (with corresponding month)

Additionally, the results will be saved to a text file named `financial_analysis.txt`.

## PyPoll
This Python script analyzes election data to determine the total number of votes cast, each candidate's percentage of votes, and the winner of the election. The analysis is based on a CSV file containing election results.

### Instructions

### Election Analysis Results
Upon running the script, the following election analysis results will be displayed in the console:
- Total number of votes cast
- Percentage of votes and total votes received by each candidate
